- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GracieSings
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code in general, and maybe one day build a daily newspaper app for myself with only good news, a daily sudoku puzzle, and perhaps the occasional math problem.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the foundations of coding through the Odin Project.
